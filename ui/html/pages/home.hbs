        Hello, my name is <b><a href="https://www.toddgriffin.me/">Todd</a></b> and I have too many project ideas.
        In order to light a fire under myself to accomplish something with some of these domain names I've bought over the years, I've created blank landing pages for all of them.
        You can find all of my other projects <b><a href="https://www.toddgriffin.me/projects">HERE</a></b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you like this project idea, please ping me on <b><a href="https://twitter.com/goddtriffin">Twitter</a></b> about it!
        I am going to succeed in finishing all of these projects, and the more popular ideas will get prioritized for completion first.
        So please loudly let me know which ones you find the most interesting!
    </p>
